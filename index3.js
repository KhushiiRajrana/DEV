// dynamic Backend authentication using express , jwt and mongoDB
// fetch --> how can you send http request from  real weite frontend to Backend , till now we are using postman to send http request to backend but in real world we have to send http request from frontend to backend and for that we use fetch method in javascript
// prowser has inbuilt fetch method to send http request to backend and get response from backend which is a part of window object in browser and we can use it like this ie using owser url  Bar or using javascript code in frontend

// fetch("http://localhost:3000/test")
// .then(response => response.text())
// .then(data => console.log(data))
// .catch(error => console.error(error));

// 3rd way is using fetch api
// proem statement is write some html code that will hit  ---> it is in index.html file
